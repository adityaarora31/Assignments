1.Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.

Note : Use 'continue' statement.

2. Write a Python program which takes two digits m (row) and n (column) as input and generates a two-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.

Note:

i = 0,1.., m-1

j = 0,1, n-1.

Hint: Use input(), list comprehension, loops, range()

Test Data : Rows = 3, Columns = 4

Expected Result : [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 2, 4, 6]]

3. Write a program which can filter even numbers in a list by using filter function. The list is: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].
Hints:
Use filter() to filter some elements in a list.
Use lambda to define anonymous functions.

4. Write a program which can map() to make a list whose elements are square of elements in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

Hints:

Use map() to generate a list.

Use lambda to define anonymous functions.

5. Write a python function using *args parameters to print name and age from list of students.

Test data: [{“name”: “abhi”, “age”: 22}, {“name”: “vikas”, “age”: 21}]

       Expected result:

name abhi
age 22
name vikas
age
